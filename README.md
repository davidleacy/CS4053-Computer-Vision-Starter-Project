# CS4053 Computer Vision Starter Project

 **NB** Run debug and release in x64.

Basic project to get OpenCV working on your pc without any need to mess around with paths.

###How to Use:
I didnt include the OpenCV Nuget Package files to reduce repo size, they're over 100mb.  

It should automatically retrieve the packages when you hit run but if not follow the below steps:
 1. Open .sln in visual studio.
 2. Go to Tools > Nuget Package Manager > Manage Nuget Packages For solution...  
 3. Then click restore packages.
 
 **NB** You need to restart VS after reinstalling the packages to get rid of the erroneous code warnings.
 
 **PS** Don't blame me if your house burns down.
